Self-Learning Framework for Visual Recognition

A general self-learning frame-work modified from R-FCN is effective on semi-supervised object de-tection. The proposed framework proposes to train object detectors by faithfully recognizing high-confidence object proposals in a self-paced way, and discovering low-confidence ones for user annotation in a active learning way.
